🔧 Project Overview
This dashboard analyzes footfall and customer behavior across multiple jewelry stores from July 1 to July 21, 2025. It focuses on understanding customer demographics, product interest, purchase conversion rates, store-wise performance, and marketing effectiveness.

2) Identify customer preferences by product, occasion, and budget.

4) Monitor agent performance in driving conversions.

5) Understand how customers learned about the brand.

6) Uncover reasons for non-purchase to inform business strategy.


📈 Chart & Visualization Types Used and Purpose
1. Bar Charts
Customer Budget Distribution

Why: Compare budget segments in a straightforward format.

Insight: Most walk-ins fall under the ₹20K–₹30K segment, suggesting pricing sweet spots.

Agent Performance

Why: Directly compare agent effectiveness by volume.

Insight: Some agents outperform others significantly — useful for incentives/training.

Customer Reasons for Not Purchasing

Why: Clarifies business pain points like price mismatch or poor design selection.

Insight: "Just Browsing" (42.1%) and "Budget Constraints" (22.8%) were key drop-off reasons.

2. Pie Charts / Donut Charts
Gender Segmentation

Age Group Segmentation

Occasion Segmentation

Awareness Source Funnel

Why Used: Pie charts are ideal for showing proportions in categorical variables.

What They Achieve:

Understand customer types (e.g., 74.6% are aged 25–40; 38.9% are female).

Know why people are visiting: 69.6% visits are for gifting.

Marketing awareness: 71.38% of customers knew the brand via Kalyan Jewellers directly.

3. Line Chart / Area Chart
Total Walk-ins & Purchases Over Time

Why: Time series charts show trends.

Insight: Spikes in walk-ins and conversions suggest potential campaign or event dates.

4. Stacked Bar / Clustered Bar Charts
Store-Wise Performance

Why: Compare multiple variables (walk-ins, purchases, conversion rates).

Insight: Some stores like KANNUR show 100% conversion (low walk-in volume but all converted), while ERODE has high footfall (280) but only 5% conversion — a clear underperformance.
